# Pizza Delivery Start Page with Animated Home and Customizable Menu in Flutter

Here I have published a code repository for a pizza delivery application. The code includes a homepage with an embedded logo image, descriptive text, and a rounded button. Upon loading, the homepage features an engaging animation. Additionally, there is a menu page with a "Menu" image and customizable product widgets displayed both horizontally and vertically. This code provides a foundation for building a pizza delivery platform, allowing developers to create a visually appealing user interface with dynamic menu options. The code is open-source and can be freely modified and adapted to suit specific branding and business requirements.
